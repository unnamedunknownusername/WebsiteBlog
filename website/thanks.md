This website would not be possible without the work of many members of the open source community

The design of this website is based on _**Computational Thinking**, a live online Julia/Pluto textbook. ~~~<a href="https://computationalthinking.mit.edu" target="_blank">(computationalthinking.mit.edu)</a>~~~
\\ 
~~~<a href="https://github.com/greimel" target="_blank">greimel</a>~~~ and the ~~~<a href="https://github.com/greimel/pluto-course-template" target="_blank">pluto-course-template</a>~~~
\\ 
And lastly, all of this is built off of the wonders of ~~~<a href="https://plutojl.org/" target="_blank">Pluto.jl</a>~~~ and the ~~~<a href="https://julialang.org/" target="_blank">~~~ Julia pogramming language
