This website would not be possible without the work of many members of the open source community.
\\
The design of this website is based on _**Computational Thinking**_, a live online Julia/Pluto textbook ~~~<a href="https://computationalthinking.mit.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(computationalthinking.mit.edu)</a>~~~ 
which was taken as inspiration by ~~~<a href="https://github.com/greimel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greimel</a>~~~ when creating the ~~~<a href="https://github.com/greimel/pluto-course-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pluto-course-template</a>~~~.
Lastly, all of this is built off of the wonders of ~~~<a href="https://plutojl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pluto.jl</a>~~~ and the ~~~<a href="https://julialang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julia pogramming language</a>~~~.
